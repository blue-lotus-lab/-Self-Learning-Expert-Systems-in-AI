# Academic Article: Integrating Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning for Developing Self-Learning Expert Systems in AI Response Selection

## Abstract

This paper introduces a framework for developing a **Self-Learning Expert System (S-LES)** aimed at optimally selecting a single response from multiple generated by different AI production models ($AI_1, AI_2, \dots$). With the goal of **reducing computational costs** and **optimizing user utility**, the system utilizes concepts from Game Theory (specifically **Pareto Optimality** and **Nash Equilibrium**) to define its **Reward Function**. The core of the system is a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent** that continuously adapts its selection policy based on query features and the outcomes of previous decisions.

## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

In response generation architectures based on Large Language Models (LLMs), multiple models with varying configurations are often invoked for a single query to ensure the quality of the final output. While this approach guarantees quality, it significantly increases **computational costs** and **latency**. The central problem is how to predict, **before invocation**, which model will produce the optimal response.

This research aims to propose a **Predictive Agent Model** that, by integrating the rational principles of **Game Theory** and the adaptability of **Reinforcement Learning**, can perform this selection in a self-learning manner.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations: Game Theory as a Utility Metric

Game Theory plays a pivotal role in this framework by **defining "best response"** and **modeling user preferences**:

### 2.1. Nash Equilibrium and Expected Utility
Nash Equilibrium helps the judging agent determine the optimal long-term probability distribution for model selection. This equilibrium is where no producing model has an incentive to unilaterally change its performance. For the RL agent, this concept leads to defining the **Expected Utility ($E[U]$)** of any decision within a specific set of query states:

$$E[U(A)] = \sum_{i \in \{1, 2\}} P(A_i | S) \cdot R(A_i)$$

where $R(A_i)$ is the final reward earned, calculated based on weighted criteria (accuracy, speed, cost).

### 2.2. Pareto Optimality and Criteria Trade-offs
The Pareto Frontier helps the agent identify the **optimal trade-off of criteria** for a specific query type. If one response is superior to another in accuracy ($x$), and the other is superior in speed ($y$), both are Pareto Optimal. The **Expert Agent**, using supervised training data, learns the preference weights $\mathbf{w}$ for each state $S$ to gravitate towards the point on the Pareto Frontier that maximizes user utility.

$$\text{Decision} = \text{argmax}_{i} (\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{Features}(A_i))$$

## 3. Architecture of the Self-Learning Expert System (S-LES)

The S-LES is designed as a model-based Reinforcement Learning system operating in a continuous learning loop:

### 3.1. Input Analysis and Feature Extraction Module
This module transforms the user query into a vector of **State Features ($S$)**. Features include: **semantic complexity**, **query type (question/command)**, and the **Ambiguity Score**. These features reflect the scenarios where models have demonstrated strategic advantages (derived from Game Theory).

### 3.2. The Reinforcement Learning Agent Core
The agent uses an RL algorithm (such as Q-Learning or DQN) to learn an **optimal policy** $\pi^*(S)$.
* **State:** The feature vector $S$ of the input query.
* **Action:** $A \in \{AI_1, AI_2\}$ (Selection of one model).
* **Value Function:** The agent learns the value function $Q(S, A)$ to estimate the maximum future reward from taking action $A$ in state $S$.

### 3.3. Utility Evaluation and Reward Module
After selecting and presenting the response to the user, the system receives **Feedback** (indirectly, such as user clicks, dwell time, or an evaluation model score). This feedback is converted into a **Reward** $R$:

$$R = \text{Utility}(\text{Selected Answer}) - \text{Penalty}(\text{Cost})$$

The earned reward is directly used to update the value function $Q(S, A)$ and consequently refine the policy $\pi^*(S)$. This adaptive process allows the system to cope with changes in the performance of the producing models (Drift).

## 4. Conclusion and Future Directions

The integration of Game Theory principles and Reinforcement Learning techniques provides a powerful methodology for constructing **Self-Learning Expert Systems** in AI content generation. By utilizing Game Theory to **define rationality and utility**, and RL to **optimize the selection policy under uncertainty and cost constraints**, the system can dynamically and efficiently choose the best and most cost-effective response for the end-user. Future development can focus on modeling social rewards and cooperative games among the models.
